PS4Macro scripts for auto-grinding XP in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2

## Dependencies

The setup requires the following:

- PS4 Remote Play
- [PS4Macro](https://github.com/komefai/PS4Macro)
- DualShock 4 Controller
- a fully-statted skater in THPS 1+2

## Setup

1. In a PS4 Remote play session with a DualShock4 controller connected, load the a supported map in free-skate mode.
1. Enable all game mods (perfect rail, manual, lip, no bails, always special)
1. **Pause the game**. Ensure the *_Continue_* menu option is selected (the first menu item)
1. Load the .xml file file in for the selected park PS4 Macro and run it on loop.

## Tips and Notes

- Disable controller vibration in the controller settings so that your controller doesn't rattle around while running the script.
- The scripts won't have perfect input, and based on variance in physics of the game won't nail the loop every time. 
- A proper run should net you 100-175XP per run, based on the following:
  - 10+ second lip trick (25xp)
  - 10+ second grind (25xp)
  - 10+ second manual (25xp)
  - 250,000+ point combo (~100xp)
